Waiting for the time when I can finally say, that this has all been wonderful but now I'm on my way.

Down with TODOs is a small C TODO manager written with ncurses.  Saves
data to a flat file, has a CLI or curses-based interface for removing
and adding items without any history of previous items.

Nice and easy, no fuss.

Upcoming features: iCloud integration. :trollface:
